## Arena Setup Guide

**NOTE**: If your arenas are bigger than 300x300, go into settings.yml and increase the grid size from 300 to your desired amount. This is the distance between each arena. I recommend doing this BEFORE you make arenas to prevent them pasting into each other.

## Setting up a default arena

1. Upload an arena schematic to the WorldEdit/schematics folder
2. Use the command `/arena create <schematic>` to create the arena.
3. Use `/arena manage` and click on the created arena to access management options.
4. Teleport to the arena and set the spawns:
    - Spawn 1: Place a fence and a Zombie Head on it. (Required)
    - Spawn 2: Place a fence and a Creeper Head on it. (Required)
    - Spectator: Place a fence and a Skeleton Skull on it. (Optional)
5. Use `/arena manage` and save the schematic where the spawns are placed.
6. Use `/arena addkit <arena> <kit>` to add a kit to that arena.
7.  Use `/arena manage` to create copies of the arena.
8.  Use `/arena manage` to enable the arena.

### How do we setup Special arena?
1. Paste a schematic from World Edit in the **Arena World**.
2. Do ``/edit`` to go into build mode.
3. Do ``/arena create <name> standalone``. 
4. Set the spawns 
- **Blue Spawn** place a blue wool and a Player Head on it.
- **Red Spawn** place a red wool and a Player Head on it.
5. For special locations like beds and portals, this is how to set them.
- Bolt detects special points using a **focal point** or **mid point**
- For **portals**, go into the middle of the portal, and place Red or Blue wool depending on team color, now on top of it, place a sponge.
- For **beds**, find the closest block you can find to the bed, place Red or Blue wool depending on team color, now on top of it, place a sponge.
6. Use the arena wand given in your first slot to select bounds, make sure you select the entire arena as Bolt's Arena System will paste it according to a grid.
7. Click in chat where it says **CLICK HERE** OR do ``/arena finish``.
8. You can now add kits to your arena using ``/arena addkit <arena>``.
9.  If your arena is standalone you can now duplicate it using ``/arena scale <amountOfCopies>`` or ``/arena manage``.

1. Upload an arena schematic to the WorldEdit/schematics folder.

   - Red Spawn: Place a fence and a Zombie Head on it. (Required)
   - Blue Spawn: Place a fence and a Creeper Head on it. (Required)
   - Spectator: Place a fence and a Skeleton Skull on it. (Optional)
5. Use `/arena manage` and save the schematic where the spawns are placed.
