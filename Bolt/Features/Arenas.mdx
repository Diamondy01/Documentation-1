## Arena Setup Guide

**NOTE**: If your arenas are bigger than 300x300, go into settings.yml and increase the grid size from 300 to your desired amount. This is the distance between each arena. I recommend doing this BEFORE you make arenas to prevent them pasting into each other.

### How do we setup default arena?
1. Paste a schematic from World Edit in the **Arena World**.
2. Do ``/edit`` to go into build mode.
3. Do ``/arena create <name> <type>``. (Arena types are two, standard and stand alone)
- Standard arenas are shared, and no build fights can take place here. (You can't duplicate these)
- Standalone arenas are build arenas, only fight can be taken here at a time. (You can duplicate these)
1. Set the spawns 
- **Spawn 1** place a fence and a Player Head on it.
- **Spawn 2** place a fence and a Player Head on it.
1. Use the arena wand given in your first slot to select bounds, make sure you select the entire arena as Bolt's Arena System will paste it according to a grid.
2. Click in chat where it says **CLICK HERE** OR do ``/arena finish``.
3. You can now add kits to your arena using ``/arena addkit <arena>``.
4. If your arena is standalone you can now duplicate it using ``/arena scale <amountOfCopies>`` or ``/arena manage``.

### How do we setup Special arena?
1. Paste a schematic from World Edit in the **Arena World**.
2. Do ``/edit`` to go into build mode.
3. Do ``/arena create <name> standalone``. 
4. Set the spawns 
- **Blue Spawn** place a blue wool and a Player Head on it.
- **Red Spawn** place a red wool and a Player Head on it.
5. For special locations like beds and portals, this is how to set them.
- Bolt detects special points using a **focal point** or **mid point**
- For **portals**, go into the middle of the portal, and place Red or Blue wool depending on team color, now on top of it, place a sponge.
- For **beds**, find the closest block you can find to the bed, place Red or Blue wool depending on team color, now on top of it, place a sponge.
6. Use the arena wand given in your first slot to select bounds, make sure you select the entire arena as Bolt's Arena System will paste it according to a grid.
7. Click in chat where it says **CLICK HERE** OR do ``/arena finish``.
8. You can now add kits to your arena using ``/arena addkit <arena>``.
9.  If your arena is standalone you can now duplicate it using ``/arena scale <amountOfCopies>`` or ``/arena manage``.
