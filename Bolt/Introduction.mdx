## FAQ

<details>
<summary>My server runs out of ram on startup.</summary>

It is recommended to allocate as much memory you can to the server
in accordance with the amount of chunks/arenas you have.

Alternatively, you can enable `WAIT-FOR-CHUNKS` in your `settings.yml` if you have `OPTIMIZED-MEMORY-ARENA-RESET` set to false,
which will load, cache then unload arena chunks to save on ram.

Add the `-noverify` flag before `-jar` in your startup command.

<summary>JVM Patch Failed error on load.</summary>

These JVM args are required to allow reflection to work properly,
