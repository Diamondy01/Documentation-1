# This is the main menu configuration file for Bolt.
# The only menus that are configurable are one's accessible by players, not Admins.
# So menus like Arena manage or Kit manage are not configurable, since you won't need to.
# You need help with the configuration or have any questions related to Bolt?
# Join us in our Discord: https://dsc.gg/refine
# 
# NOTE: All Material IDs are supported from 1.8x-1.20.x. Recommended: https://minecraftitemids.com/

# This is the global menu configuration section.
# These configurations apply to all menus and are for the buttons that are built-in.
GLOBAL:
  
  # Should menus be updated async? This can break for modern versions sometimes.
