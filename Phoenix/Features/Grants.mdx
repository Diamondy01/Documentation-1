A grant adds a rank to player for a set duration, which is determined as the grant is created. The duration can be permanent or temporary.

Each grant has a scope, which is a single or group of servers that the grant applies on. The scope can be `global`, which means the player will have that rank on all servers.

A reason has to be specified for each grant, either using your preset grant reasons, or a custom reason.

## Grant Menu

The grant menu is where you create a grant to be applied to a player.

Permission: `core.command.grant`

You need a permission to grant each rank, for example: `core.grant.vip` which grants the vip rank. You can use `core.grant.*` to allow all ranks.
