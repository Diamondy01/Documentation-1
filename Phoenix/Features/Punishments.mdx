Punishments allow staff members to take disciplinary action against players behavior. The punishment types include blacklists, bans, mutes, shadow mutes, kicks, warns and competative bans.

Punishments can be temporary or permanent, they can also be applied to a players IP address, so it applies to all of their [alts](/Phoenix/Features/Alts).

Shadow mutes make a player think other players can see their messages in chat but they cant, while a normal mute prevents them from chatting altogether.

A player can be punished through commands or by using the punish menu which allows the use of punishment ladders, this is the recommended way.

# Punishment Ladders

Punishment ladders are a sequential list of punishments that apply to a player depending on how many times they have been banned by the ladder.

Punishment ladders can be used with the punish command or through resolving reports as true.

# Proof

The proof menu is where you can attach a link or chat snapshot to a punishment, for example a chat snapshot can be attached if the player was muted.
