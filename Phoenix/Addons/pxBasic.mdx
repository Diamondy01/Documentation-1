pxBasic adds a bunch of commands found in base minecraft and some extra,
allowing configuration of how they work and their messages.

I also adds some helpful features such as tips and the addition of a welcome message.

## God Mode

If a player is in god mode, all damage dealt to them will be cancelled.

## Tips

Tips are messages that are sent out to player that have tips enabled at a regular interval.
These are configurable in the `tips.yml` file.

## Welcome Message

pxBasic adds a configurable welcome message can be sent to players when they join the server.
