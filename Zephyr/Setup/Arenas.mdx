## Creating arenas

1. Set `SETUP-MODE: true` in settings.yml (line 32)
2. Use `/arena create <name>` to create a new arena
    - The plugin automatically creates a new empty world with the arena's name
    - The world will have a stone block at Y = 128, which is also the default spawn location of the world
3. Paste your schematic in the world
4. Set the bounds of the arena:
    - Use `/arena pos1 <arena>` to set the lowest corner of the arena (Required)
    - Use `/arena pos2 <arena>` to set the highest corner of the arena (Required)
5. Use `/arena setspawn <arena>` to set the location where players will spawn after joining
6. Use `/arena setGameHeight <arena>` to set the Y-level where players should be taken as in-game
    - When player goes below the configured Y-level, they'll automatically receive the kit and will
      be set as in-game.
7. Use `/arena setKit <arena> <kit>` to set the kit for the arena
8. Use `/arena setBuildLimit <arena>` to set the build Y-limit for the arena (Optional)
    - This step is optional, but if you dont want your players to be able
      to build to spawn, I recommend setting this.
9. Use `/arena setDeathHeight <arena>` to set the Y-level where players will die (Optional)
    - By default, players die at Y-level 0
10. Use `/arena saveAll` to manually save all arenas (Optional)
11. Restart the server after creating at least one arena
    - You do not need to restart after creating every single arena.
    - Just make sure to restart after you create the first arena to prevent errors
    (doesnt matter whether you restart after creating all arenas or after creating the first arena)

## Deleting arenas

1. Assure that no players are currently in the arena you want to delete
2. Use `/arena delete <arena> [deleteWorld]`
    - deleteWorld: Whether should the arena world be deleted along with the arena (Optional)
    - Default value: `false`
3. Use `/arena saveAll` to manually save all arenas (Optional)
