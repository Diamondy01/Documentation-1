### FAWE Legacy with JDK 17 Support

:::warning NOTE
Only works with carbon!
:::

The FAWE version we are currently using will not work with Java 11+, For specifically this reason, CarbonSpigot has native support for the [FAWE-Legacy Fork](https://github.com/whilein/fawe-legacy) that supports java 17. It is recommended to use this with Carbon along with Java 17.

:::note
Use WorldEdit 6.1.7 with this.
:::

You will also need the following JVM Args:
- --add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.misc=ALL-UNNAMED
- --add-opens=java.base/jdk.internal.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED
- --add-opens=java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED

*The above given java arguments are necessary for Carbon to break reflection filters and allow unsafe access to FAWE*
