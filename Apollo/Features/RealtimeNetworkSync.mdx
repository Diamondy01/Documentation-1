title: Realtime Network Sync
---

Apollo Realtime Network Sync allows you to sync Apollo data and alerts between all your different instances via a ValKey / KeyDB server.

This is useful on bungeecord networks, and can provide general performance improvements, while also preventing certain bugs on networks with multiple server instances running Apollo.

## Setup

1. Locate `connected-alerts` in your `config.conf` file.
2. Set `host` and `port` to point towards your ValKey / KeyDB server.
3. If required, set `username`/`password` for authentication.
4. Customize `format` and set `enabled` to `true`.

## ValKey / KeyDB

Realtime Network Sync requires a [Valkey](https://valkey.io/) or [KeyDB](https://docs.keydb.dev/docs/ppa-deb) database to be setup (KeyDB is a higher performance database that can be used with Apollo Realtime Network Sync)

:::info
To avoid issues, make sure to set the `maxmemory-policy` value of the KeyDB server config to `allkeys-lfu`, and to set the `maxmemory` value to a reasonable value like `4000mb` for 4gb.
